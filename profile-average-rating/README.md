# ðŸ“Š Profile Average Rating

Letterboxd shows you your star distribution, but not the actual *average*.

This script fixes that by calculating a proper weighted score and adding it to your profile page.

Finally, you (and everyone else) can finally see your true average that reflects how you really rate movies. Star distributions are pretty, but numbers don't lie.
