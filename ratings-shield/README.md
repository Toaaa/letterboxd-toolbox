# üõ°Ô∏è Ratings Shield

Whenever I'm browsing for films to add to my watchlist, I've noticed how low averages can quietly scare me off, even if the movie itself looks interesting (and sometimes actually turns out to be pretty good). And when it's time to rate something I've just watched, seeing the community score beforehand can make me second-guess my own reaction or feelings.

This script fixes that by hiding the average ratings and popular reviews on a film's page until you've marked it as watched, reviewed or logged. That way, you get to form your own opinion first, without the hive mind whispering in your ear.

Because sometimes [ignorance is bliss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JODWCwycNmg), at least until you've seen the movie.
